Scripts for Synthesizer V Studio Pro

## How to use

In the program, select the "Scripts -> Open scripts folder" menu to access the "scripts" folder. Make sure to place the downloaded scripts inside that folder, then scan again from the "Scripts -> Rescan" menu. You are now ready to use them to improve your workflow.

## Invert Selection
Inverts the current note selection (If no notes are selected, it selects all and if all are selected, it deselects all).

## Select Notes by Duration

Selects notes that are equal to or longer than the specified duration (1/4 beat, 1/2 beat, 1 beat, 2 beats, 3 beats, 4 beats). This can be useful to select long notes (e.g. longer than 2 beats) and in the side panel set the vibrato of all of them together, for example.
